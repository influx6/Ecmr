# say for example you have a build.js file located within your current directory that when runned builds all your files for you and ends after execution,the time taking to move back and forth between your terminal and texteditor can become unoptimal,so why do so:

# ecmr - eternal commandline runner
		: is a simple,small script to run any commands at interval of 1 second or one provided,meaning you can go code away knowing that you build files will update with changes every second and without having to worry so much or move endlessly back and forth.
		
		
Example:

	1. To simple run ls(list directory command) every 3 seconds
		
			$: ecmr -c "ls" -t 3
		
		or running git push every 30 seconds
		
			$: ecmr -c "git push origin master" -t 30
			
Arguments:

		-c or -command: specify the one-time running command to run in interval
		-t or -timeout: specify the interval to run the command(specify in seconds)
